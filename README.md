# Physics From First Principles

This repository documents my self-study of classical mechanics
using *Kleppner & Kolenkow* and a CS50-style problem-solving approach.

## Core Belief
Physics is not memorization.
It is the art of identifying systems, constraints, and invariants.

## What This Repo Shows
- How I approach unseen problems
- How intuition is built from equations
- How mistakes sharpen understanding

## Method
Every problem follows:
1. System definition
2. Coordinate choice
3. Force diagram
4. Equations of motion
5. Constraints
6. Solution & sanity checks
